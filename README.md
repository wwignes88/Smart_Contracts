1) A good portion of this year was spent on the Uniswap project, which forthe time being I've decided to post as private. This project aside, for the other repositories posted I was still learning the ropes as a Solidity developer, so the codes might lack elegance. Furthermore, these public repositories were not analyzed for security purposes, so take them as learning examples for those interested in the respective protocols and/ or their adaption to eth-brownie (the interactive web3 tool which all of the listed repos utilize).

2) Chainlinks newly released CCIP protocol was, at the time of posting, only available on testnets.

3) The VRF_Mock_with_Oracle project has a readme pdf file which should be consulted for those who are new to taking on independent projects (outside of bootcamp) on their own. This project makes use of 'EventWatcher' which listens for emitted events.
